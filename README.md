# Notifier
A, currently, very primitive plugin that notifies players of incoming server shutdown without shutting down the server.

# Why?
I needed to warn players and kick them before my linux server automaticly shut down for power savings at night. 
I didn't want players to get imersed into something important and then all of the sudden the sever disconnects them.
This solution simply warns players of the shutdown as it aproaches.
